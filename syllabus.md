# IMPORTANT NOTICES


## 1. HEALTH AND WELLNESS

-   Covid-19 and other respiratory viruses are continuing to evolve and
    infection and hospitalization rates continue to show depressing
    cycles of surge and fall, at both a local and national level&#x2013;long
    beyond what was hoped almost four years ago.

-   To reduce the risk of infection and increase the possibility of
    wellness allowing us to focus on learning and working together,
    please be monitor your health and be mindful of others around
    you. You are always welcome to wear a mask in class for whatever
    reason and the professor will frequently do so.

-   This is a request for us to think socially about how our choices
    impact others and how we can maximize learning opportunities.
    **Please respect each other's choices on this issue**.


## 2. ATTENDANCE, ZOOM AND CLASS RECORDINGS

-   **ZOOM AND CLASS ATTENDANCE WHEN UNWELL** - If you feel sick or are
    showing symptoms of Covid-19, flu or cold then **PLEASE BE
    CONSIDERATE** of your classmates and attend the class remotely
    through Zoom. All class sessions will be available live through Zoom
    (see links in Canvas) and as recordings.

-   Please make use of ****absence notices**** in `Path@Penn` to inform the
    professor if you need to miss class due to extenuating
    circumstances. Submitting an absence notice does not excuse students
    from their course obligations. But you can view missed class session
    in class recordings in Canvas.

# Course Description Goals and Objectives

Increasingly, our daily communications involve responding to and
interacting with language produced by artificial intelligence
models. On the surface, large language models (LLMs) and generative AI
tools (e.g ChatGPT, Bard, etc.) appear to have crossed a milestone in
terms of their human-like ability to generate coherent and idiomatic
texts. This has significant implications (both positive and negative)
for human communication systems and their products, from creative
fiction to news, from academic texts to social media content. It also
raises many questions around whether we can identify, trust, learn
from and use AI generated language.

In this course, we will begin to answer these questions in two
ways:

1.  Analyzing Key Issues: Drawing upon relevant frameworks in
    communication and language theory we will explore the
    transformative nature of AI-generated communication and its impact
    on individuals and society.
2.  Hands-on Application: In parallel, students will acquire skills
    using Python in implementing machine and deep learning models to
    better understand how they work and explore their abilities and
    limitations. We will code various AI models, such as a simple voice
    assistant, image classifier, misinformation identifier, and a basic
    text generative application.

Through this course students will be equipped for a range of contexts
impacted by developments in AI. The course requires students to have a
basic experience in Python coding and using Jupyter notebooks.


## Objectives

Through this course students will:

-   Develop an understanding of how LLMs work at various conceptual
    levels (above the low-level technical/mathematical), including the
    three stages of training (pre-training, fine-tuning and RLHF) and
    the key component of these models, namely the `Transformer`

-   Consider questions of:
    -   `how` and `what` LLMs learn during training and ongoing usage
    -   what level and kind of (if any) understanding and representation of meaning do LLMs exhibit and actually have
    -   to what extent are LLMs able to reason, plan, create models of the world and others (e.g. Theory of Mind)
    -   what kinds of `emergent` knowledge and behaviors LLMs seem to
        exhibit as they increase in size (of both data and parameters) and the implications of these phenomena

-   Learn the basic theoretical framework and concepts from pragmatics
    (the theory of `meaning in context` in language use) and consider and test `if` and `how` LLMs are able to

# Schedule


## **NOTE** This is a tentative schedule is will be updated as the course progresses


## Class structure

-   Usually each class session will be divided into two parts:

-   **Content and Discussion** - This part of the class will introduce
    and review the key topics onlined in the schedule. It is important
    that you read the assigned material BEFORE the class as you'll be
    expected to engage in discussion and other activities based on this
    content.
-   **Lab activities** - The second part will be focused on pratical
    exercises to put into practice what we have been learning about
    thinking about, collecting, analyzing, interpreting and
    communicating data. This will include learning some basic steps
    using Python and R scripts and some other tools for data analysis
    and visualization.
